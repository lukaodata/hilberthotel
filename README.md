This workbook models Hilbert's Hotel, an imaginary hotel with countably infinite rooms. It shows two strategies for freeing rooms:
- Shift every guest one room forward: f(n) = n + 1
- Move each guest into even-numbered rooms: f(n) =2n
A final row illustrates the concept of infinity (âˆž) for both guest numbers and their new assignments.
